### 学习helm前准备

确保k8s环境正常

``` shell
controlplane $ kubectl version --short
Client Version: v1.18.0
Server Version: v1.18.0

controlplane $ kubectl get cs
NAME                 STATUS    MESSAGE             ERROR
controller-manager   Healthy   ok
scheduler            Healthy   ok
etcd-0               Healthy   {"health":"true"}

controlplane $ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://172.17.0.15:6443
dash-kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://172.17.0.15:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:dash-kubernetes-dashboard:https/proxy
KubeDNS is running at https://172.17.0.15:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

controlplane $ kubectl get nodes
NAME           STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
controlplane   Ready    master   145m   v1.18.0
node01         Ready    <none>   145m   v1.18.0
```

### 安装helm3

安装和查看helm3

``` shell
controlplane $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
controlplane $ helm version --short
v3.4.2+g23dd3af
```

查看helm安装的环境变量

``` shell
controlplane $ helm env
HELM_BIN="helm"
HELM_CACHE_HOME="/root/.cache/helm"
HELM_CONFIG_HOME="/root/.config/helm"
HELM_DATA_HOME="/root/.local/share/helm"
HELM_DEBUG="false"HELM_KUBEAPISERVER=""HELM_KUBEASGROUPS=""HELM_KUBEASUSER=""HELM_KUBECONTEXT=""HELM_KUBETOKEN=""HELM_MAX_HISTORY="10"HELM_NAMESPACE="default"HELM_PLUGINS="/root/.local/share/helm/plugins"HELM_REGISTRY_CONFIG="/root/.config/helm/registry.json"
HELM_REPOSITORY_CACHE="/root/.cache/helm/repository"
HELM_REPOSITORY_CONFIG="/root/.config/helm/repositories.yaml"
```

搜索charts

the canonical source for Helm charts is https://artifacthub.io/

```shell
hem search hub 

# You can search the Helm Hub for specific charts
helm search hub redis
```

添加仓库

``` shell
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo list

# 搜索特定仓库
helm search repo bitnami

# 搜索特定仓库下面的特定chart
helm search repo bitnami/redis

helm show chart bitnami/redis
helm show readme bitnami/redis
helm show values bitnami/redis
```

安装chart

``` shell
helm install  bitnami/redis --gernerate-name
helm install my-redis bitnami/redis --version 10.7.16 --namespace redis
```



``` shell
helm delete my-redis -n redis

kubectl delete namespace redis
```



添加chart到chartmuseum

``` shell
helm package repotest

curl --data-binary "@repotest-0.1.0.tgz" "http://xxxxx/api/charts" 
```



或者直接拷贝到storage目录也是可以的



需要helm repo update

helm search repo -l xxxx   // list all the version



安装helm push  plugin

helm plugin list

helm push helmpushdemo/  mychartmuseumrepo  // 不需要package，然后upload



helm lint 

helm test



helm monitor 插件，感觉用处不大



kudo-通过无代码方式优化kubernetes operator开发体验



Thus it is often useful to see not just the summary info for a chart, but exactly which versions exist for a chart

```shell
helm search repo drupal --versions
```

 helm install mysite bitnami/drupal



In Helm 2, instance names were cluster-wide

In Helm 3, naming has been changed. Now instance names are scoped to Kubernetes namespaces



The best way is to create a YAML file with all of the configuration overrides



```shell
helm install mysite bitnami/drupal --values values.yaml
```

In Helm2， helm install -f

 --set drupalUsername=admin



`helm list` is namespace aware.

```shell
 helm list --all-namespaces
```



On occasion, you may want to force one of your services to restart.This is not something you need to use Helm for. You can simply use `kubectl` itself to restart things.

With an operating system’s package manager, you do not use the package manager to restart a program. Likewise, you don’t need to use Helm to restart your webserver or database.

是的，比如configmap修改了需要重启服务。



new chart version

``` shel
helm repo update

# the default policy of Helm is to attempt to use the latest version of a chart.
helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal --version 6.2.22

```







``` shell
$ helm install mysite bitnami/drupal --values values.yaml 
$ helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal

# some settings could be changed back to their defaults. This is usually not what you want
helm upgrade mysite bitnami/drupal --reuse-values
```

Helm core maintainers suggest that you provide consistent configuration with each installation and upgrade.



```
helm uninstall mysite --namespace first
```



 Helm stores these records as Kubernetes secrets

``` shell
$ kubectl get secret
NAME                           TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-vjhx2            kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      58m
mysite-drupal                  Opaque                                1      13m
mysite-mariadb                 Opaque                                2      13m
sh.helm.release.v1.mysite.v1   helm.sh/release.v1                    1      13m
sh.helm.release.v1.mysite.v2   helm.sh/release.v1                    1      13m
sh.helm.release.v1.mysite.v3   helm.sh/release.v1                    1      7m53s
sh.helm.release.v1.mysite.v4   helm.sh/release.v1                    1      5m30s
```



The Dry-run Flag

--dry-run

Helm will dump a trove of information to standard output, including all of the rendered templates. Then it will exit without sending the objects to Kuberentes and without creating any release records.



Helm maintainers noticed a trend among users. People wanted to use `--dry-run` to use Helm as a template engine, and then use other tools (like `kubectl`) to send the rendered output to Kubernetes.

* Dry-run mixes non-YAML information with the rendered template



While `--dry-run` is designed for debugging, `helm template` is designed to isolate the template rendering process of Helm from the installation or upgrade logic





Because Helm does not contact a Kubernetes cluster during a `helm template` run, it does not do complete validation of the output. It is possible that Helm will not catch some errors in this case. You may choose to use the `--validate` flag if you want that behavior, but in this case Helm will need a valid `kubeconfig` file with credentials for a cluster.

1. Load the chart
2. Parse the values
3. Execute the templates
4. Render the YAML
5. Send it to Kubernetes

Each time we upgrade that `mysite` installation, a new secret will be created to track each release. 

 Helm tracks up to ten revisions of each installation. Once an installation exceeds ten releases,



``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  release: SDRzSUFBQU... # Lots of Base64-encoded data removed
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-08-11T18:37:26Z"
  labels: 1
    modifiedAt: "1597171046"
    name: mysite
    owner: helm
    status: deployed
    version: "3"
  name: sh.helm.release.v1.mysite.v3
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "1991"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets/sh.helm.release.v1.mysite.v3
  uid: cbb8b457-e331-467b-aa78-1e20360b5be6
type: helm.sh/release.v1
```

labels 记录了helm metadata

That blob contains a gzipped representation of the chart and release.



`helm get` sub-commands (`hooks`, `manifests`, `notes`, `values`, and `all`).



```
helm get values wordpress --revision 2
```

```
helm history wordpress
```

```
helm rollback wordpress 2
```

A rollback does *not* restore to a previous snapshot of the cluster. Helm does not track enough information to do that. What it does is re-submit the previous configuration, and Kubernetes attempts to reset the resources to match.

helm 只是重新提交上次的配置，不会保留上次的整个状态

并且，避免 hand-edit resources

This is one of the many reasons Helm core maintainers recommend against hand-editing resources. If all edits are made through Helm, then you can use Helm tools effectively and with no guesswork



helm uninstall 可以--keep-history保留历史





--generate-name

 Helm generates a name based on a combination of the chart name and a timestamp

在helm2中是一个friendly names ,显得不专业



提供了一个名字模板功能

```shell
--generate-name --name-template "foo-{{ randAlpha 9 | lower }}"
```



it is worth pointing out that Helm 3 assumes by default that if you attempt to deploy a chart into a namespace, that namespace was already created.

默认需要命名空间存在

--create-namespace

但这是不安全的

it probably needs access controls (like RBACs) and other things assigned to it before it can be safely used in production. In short, it views silently creating a namespace as an opportunity for unintentionally creating a security hole.

There is not an analogous `--delete-namespace` on `helm uninstall`. And the reason for this falls out of Helm’s defensiveness regarding global objects.
