### python代码规范

#### python之禅

```python
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.	美比丑好
Explicit is better than implicit.	明确比隐式好	
Simple is better than complex.	简单比复杂好
Complex is better than complicated.	组合比复杂好
Flat is better than nested.	扁平比嵌套好
Sparse is better than dense.	稀疏比密集好
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```



#### 基本项（General concepts）

1. 一条语句一行（One statement per line）

```python
不好的写法

print（'one'); print('two')

if x == 1: print('one')
    
if <复杂的表达式> and <另外复杂的表达式>:
	# do something

好的写法
print('one')
print('two')

if x ==1:
    print('one')

cond1 = <复杂的表达式>
cond2 = <另外复杂的表达式>
if cond1 and cond2:
    # do something
```



2. 创建一个N个相同元素的列表

```
four_nones = [None]*4
```



3. 使用_来定义不用的变量

```
basename, _, ext = filename.rpartition('.')
```





#### PEP8

PEP8是python代码规范指南



缩进

use 4个空格
